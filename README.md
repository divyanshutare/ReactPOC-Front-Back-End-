# ReactPOC-Front-Back-End
It has backend as well as frontend folder as I have made some changes in backend

# For Running BackEnd Project
run the following command
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
After this create a dummy database in mongodb by looking at models present in the project

# For Running FrontEnd Project
run the following command
```
npm install 
npm run
```
And now you can run the FontEnd on 'localhost:3000/'
